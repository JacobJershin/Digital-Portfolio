	If you'd like to read some of essays, the links are below. I've writen 2 essays so far, one on AI Senteience which is located 	<a id="levelSlots" href="./CS-III/Essays/AI%20Sentience.html">Here</a> and one on Fingerprints which is located <a id="levelSlots" href="./CS-III/Essays/Fingerprints.html">Here</a>. The reason I made this digital portfolio is because it's important to me.
