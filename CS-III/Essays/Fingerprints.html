      The purpose of a secure HTTPS connection is to allow the transfer of infermation safely and securely and to let you share your files, folders, and more through the internet. This means that any time a sucsessful HTTPS connection is made the information its send is enctyped and decrypted approperitly inorder to facilitate the safe transfer of potentially sensitive data.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      an HTTPS proxey appliance is esentially a fake server that an organziation can use in order to get data from a user whos connected to the web. This way they can gather and sell user data to advertizers, hackers, or anyone they want in order to use you for their profit.

      MITM (man in the middle) attacks are when an attacker puts them self between a conversation over the web. They pretend to be invisible by sending the data that was sent by either of the parties to the other party while also copying it for their own gain. not only thatbut they can even also change and manipulate data. However most of these risks are null due to built in HTTPS security. (thats what the S stands for)

      Hash is an algorithm that puts data on to fixed out put sizes. this way people cant change or manipulate data from MITM attacks. A good has follows the following criteria. every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability. The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of collisions—pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value—increases. If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      Note that this criterion only requires the value to be uniformly distributed, not random in any sense. A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function, but the converse need not be true.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      Hash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs. For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names. In these cases, the uniformity criterion should hold for almost all typical subsets of entries that may be found in the table, not just for the global set of all possible entries.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      In other words, if a typical set of m records is hashed to n table slots, the probability of a bucket receiving many more than m/n records should be vanishingly small. In particular, if m is less than n, very few buckets should have more than one or two records. A small number of collisions is virtually inevitable, even if n is much larger than m – see the birthday problem.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      In special cases when the keys are known in advance and the key set is static, a hash function can be found that achieves absolute (or collisionless) uniformity. Such a hash function is said to be perfect. There is no algorithmic way of constructing such a function - searching for one is a factorial function of the number of keys to be mapped versus the number of table slots they're tapped into. Finding a perfect hash function over more than a very small set of keys is usually computationally infeasible; the resulting function is likely to be more computationally complex than a standard hash function and provides only a marginal advantage over a function with good statistical properties that yields a minimum number of collisions. See universal hash function. ("Hash function: Properties: Uniformity" 2022)

      A CA is pretty much an ID for web servers and web sites so that way HTTPS proxey appliances cant pretend to be a website or server because they dont have the verified CA needed for a user to interact with them.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
      SSL interception can be prevented by using a secure, safe browser, and or a VPN. However SSL interception cant be fully prevented. an SSL interception however can be dected by comparing a servers CA to another CA, if the 2 dont match then there is at the very least an SLL interception. A false postitive is when the 2 CAs dont match even though the connection was secure. a false negative is when the 2 CAs match even though potentially an HTTPS Proxey Appliance was used and or a MITM attack happened.

      Personally I dont belive that my anyone should have the right to "eavesdrop" on my internet communications. What I search, do, say, and more in the private should stay in private just as what I do say and more at home stays with me and only me. My online presence should be as secure as my real life presence when in private. However this should not apply to things done or said on public forms, cites, etc. should be as public as things done in public in the real world.
