	Most of this essay will be done through the asking of questions rather than the answering of the topic. That's because this topic is much too vague and ambiguous for any sort of answer, even a subjective answer is too hard to give. I will still try my best to answer the question and topic properly however it might not be satisfactory to some. </p><br><br>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
      Sentient AI is a hot topic in today's world, seemingly the modern census is that it will either lead humanity to utopia or lead humanity to dystopia. Many people argue about the code, math, science, statistics, engineering, ethics, morality, and more of what sentient AI even means and would entail. Personally I believe it will, or rather could, lead humanity to utopia however us as humans shouldn’t or rather it would be morally "incorrect" for whatever my idea of morality is, to create a sentient AI to serve and benefit humanity. </p><br><br>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
      Let's start by asking can there even be a definition on the property of sentience? Ignoring all the code, math, and science of a sentient AI, sentient is defined as A sentient being is one who perceives and responds to sensations of whatever kind—sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell. -merriam webster By that definition your toaster is sentient. It can feel when you push down the little handle and we know it can feel because it responds to that stimulus by toasting its toasty bits. So maybe we need a more fluid definition, maybe sentience is the ability of free will. Free thinking is something often attributed to only humans, animals and anything that can't make choices based off of an algorithm. By that logic AI might never be sentient as computers can never make choices randomly. RNG or random number generators are only algorithms; they aren't actually random; a computer can never make something up at random; it can only create based off of what it knows. But then again, maybe humans can't either, is art just a recreation and recombination of every other art piece we've seen, every thought we've had, experiences we've shared, every prior chemical reaction in our head. Are all the choices we make entirely made up of everything that's happened before us? Then who was the first person to set in motion the everlasting domino chain that's still cascading today? You see we quickly run into problems when trying to even define this prompt. </p><br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
	So maybe we're looking at this in the wrong way, instead of defining what sentience means to humans byIf we ask the question, what does it mean to give sentience to an AI? Let's start by answering the morality of this question. Would it be "morally ok" to, for a lack of a better word, give birth to an AI so smart it has free will and thought? In my opinion it wouldn't though it's a very very very Grey area. Let me start my argument with an analogy, humans who kill each oother could be seen as "playing god" . It's morally wrong by society and legally wrong by law. Now for birth humans who give birth to other humans, it's seen as something good, well in most cases, birth is a happy thing. That's not playing god. However what is playing god is the creation of non human? Human like, life by humans, created in the eye of humans. You may argue that animals are technically made for humans but they aren't human like, I mean something inherently and unequivocally alive and free created by humans to serve humanity and its goals. Personally I believe the creation hy humans of non human, human like life is playing God, as God made man in his image. I do see how insane a notion like this seems which is why I called it's such a big gray area earlier but it's something I came to the conclusion of in my time thinking of how to answer this prompt. </p><br><br>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
	In conclusion I'm not really sure nor am I confident that anyone knows what would happen if AI were to become sentient, but I am under the belief that if people were to make a sentient AI that it would be immoral.
