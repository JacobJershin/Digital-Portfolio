	Bias is something that impacts everyone, without bias our statements would have no basis and without basis we have nothing to form thoughts off of. It’s because of this that every decision made has some sort of bias no matter who made it or the intentions behind it. It is this decision bias I intend to inform about in this essay.
  </p><br><br>
      <p>
	There are plenty of biases that could impact a decision, things from intent, to feelings, to influence can all impact the way we think and choose. Each and every bias comes with its own reasons and influence too. While working on our group's independent student project we will have to make a number of hard decisions, each of these decisions with their own bias. However not all biases our out of touch from their topic. Lots of times bias is actually a good thing however it's these times when bias is out of touch from its core topic that our ISP’s group will need to pinpoint, and eradicate. 
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
	One form of bias found in the real world is attribution bias, when bias is a collective opinion held by the decision makers. For example a group of people who all can all understand and do process x include process x in their mock scheduling application when in actuality it might not be as simple or straightforward as the group of decision makers believe it is.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
	This is the first of the many biases I expect we will encounter during the creation of our independent student project, the mock scheduling application. To be more specific I believe this will occur during the creation of the layout of the website as it is something so ambiguous that almost every tiny, minute detail we choose to include or discard comes with their own very small yet very biased decision. To be even more specific I believe this will most likely occur during the order of events we want our users to go through while creating their next year's mock schedule. Last year we believed students would have a simple time understanding where to click to get anywhere on the website, obviously the button at the top of the screen that says “scheduler” however since we created the website we knew that that one button of several would take you to the scheduler someone first arriving to the site might not understand that this button is the one that takes you to the place where you create your schedule. Many people got confused by the assortment of buttons and colors on the home screen and were unsure of what they were actually supposed to do and where they were supposed to go.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
To avoid any kind of bias of this nature I believe it is imperative that we get people to test our website who are not from or involved in any kind of CS class and are students of allen highschool. With their opinions and thoughts we can have a clearer, more cohesive final product then what we could come up with on our own.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
	The next bias I believe we will encounter is a sort of cosmetic bias. Traditionally cosmetic bias is “an illusion that particular texts or materials have been infused with equity and diversity when in fact minimal efforts to conduct research and address diversity throughout the entire text have been made.” as quoted by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. However this form of cosmetic bias is more literal than it may seem.
	
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
	I believe that when creating our website we will have to make a number of decisions that all come down to cosmetics of how the site we make may look. We will most likely clash on how we want the site to ultimately look in the end. Our own individual ideas may seem great in our heads alone however when it comes to the final product something that may have seemed clear to that individual alone now may seem confusing and strange. This is something that we struggled a lot with last year but because we have encountered it before we have a much clearer and better idea of what functionality and cosmetics we want the site to have this year. Therefore I believe the only thing we will need to correct for in our trajectory to success equation is to combine our ideas into one and let a single person be the glue that ultimately gives a yes or no to our cosmetic ideas so we don't spend countless hours or even days arguing about simple changes.

      <p>
	The next form of bias I expect we will encounter during the creation of our website is confirmation bias, specifically during the final phases of the website's creation. Confirmation bais is “when data is analyzed and interpreted to confirm hypotheses and expectations. It is one of the most detrimental biases found in user research. A researcher’s role is to be a source of truth, even if the findings contradict expectations. Remember that all findings, positive or negative, are valid and should be reported on.” - Emma Jones, UX Consultant of experience UX.
	
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
	During these final phases of the website's creation there will be a number of times we will have to ask people to test our site and give us feedback. During this time it is imperative that we listen and let them tell us what to change instead of letting it come in one ear and out the other. To be more specific when a test subject goes through our site and completes making a schedule we have to take in what they struggled with and fix it we cant just assume tell ourselves they were dumb and didnt know what to do. If a user doesn't know what to do at a certain point in the scheduling process we have to go in and make it more clear on what the user needs to do.
