      Adheesh-katru’s proposal was an automated plantation. It would cut down on the amount of Non-GMO food in the market by creating an automated garden that would grow the food and show the user exactly where the food comes from in the market. I considered this proposal however I'm ultimately rejecting it due to the fact I don't know nearly enough about the problem or solution to be of significant help to the cause. <br>

      Boden’s ISP was perhaps the most interesting to me, I find the idea of an automated CSS maker very interesting to me. The idea seemed challenging and fun to work on however I’m rejecting it because there are already plenty of sites such as square space that let you make websites with already built in templates and easy to understand UI. The idea has already been done and It seems like a lot of work to just recreate something that pretty much already exists. <br>

      Connor church's ISP was probably the one I was considering the most. It's a neat idea that blends facial recognition with hardware with software and all around seemed like a funny concept. Their project's main goal was to create some sort of device that tracks the users attentiveness and awareness and whenever they start to doze off it has some sort of ability to wake up the user. I ended up rejecting this project due to a lack of interest from anyone else in the project meaning it would have become a 2 man job but something this complicated likely would need a team of at least 4 or 5 to be successful.<br>

      Caysen mayo’s ISP was to make a unity game targeted ages 13-17. It would be a “high quality 11/10 unity game.” pretty solid plan however the lack of ideas floating around what the game could be and the fact that I’m already working on my own unity game and have been for about a year now means that I would have to stop working on my own game and focus more on this one which is something I don’t intend to do. <br>

      Dylan pettijohn’s ISP was fairly interesting to me. Their goal was to put RFID labels inside of each student and staff ID and install scanners at each entrance that would scan for if a student were to leave or enter the building providing for safety and attendance. However I did not decide to work on this ISP because of how invasive it felt, I like the idea however it just seems too much. I don't like the idea of Allen highschool being able to track where we are and when we leave the building at all times and what happens if you forget your ID or just go around the scanner or enter through one of the back doors in the school. <br>

      Farhan Ishraque’s ISP seemed pretty neat, Their idea was to make a market that sells high end PC parts to gamers. Personally this is something that I would use in my own life however I did not accept the ISP because business like amazon and bust buy pretty much have a monopoly on the market already and I’ve never tried to market or sell a product before and I feel like i would be pretty bad at it  <br>

      Instead of choosing an ISP I am unfamiliar with and will have to spend lots of time catching up for lack of better words to the host of the ISP I’ve decided to work on the backend for the mock scheduler. Unlike last year I’ve gotten significantly better at backend and javascript, I know for a fact I can make an auto scheduler. In fact I already have a similar system working for another project that I did in my own time that has you input a geometry dash level ID and it returns levels of similar style on the GD servers.
