      As a software engineer I have lots of work to get to but mostly I just need to stay focused on optimizing and bug fixing code. The roll of a software engineer consists of the creation, and further optimizition of existing code. My job on the ISP will mostly reflect this. I've been given the roll of backend engineer to help write an API and work on website backend for the mock scheulder. In years past the API is just an expanssion and rework of previous years however this year we've been tasked to make one from scratch using (most likely using) postman. I have very little experince using postman however so I'll spend some aditional time this week researching how to host and run an API.

      This week thankfully hasnt posed any technical challenges for the project. Infact from a technical stand point we've actually made pretty good work on the project as a whole. we've got our github set up, discord server made, and we even have a google spread sheet to help organize our selves better.<br><br>
      as for scheduling conflicts, our progress seems to remain at a steady state and hopefully it'll remain this way. Unlike last year we've learned how to set our selves up for success, we're making sure to stay much more organized and focused on the task at hand rather than the project as a whole. All and all it's going pretty well I think. <br>

	I accomplished a lot this week considering this is the first week I’ve really had for my ISP. starting off I wrote out my stack and finalized it, I wrote some of the api endpoints, and lastly I made good work on the front end. <br><br>
	</div>
	<div style="text-indent: 50px;">
	The stack I decided to go with was google sheets of all things as the database since the original duty master was on google sheets and I needed to pick a database that would be easy for Allen teachers to understand and edit. For the api I used express JS, node and google apis to host the database. Lastly the front end will be hosted on a github.io page unless I can get funding to host it on a proper url of allen’s choice. <br><br>
	</div>
	<div style="text-indent: 50px;">
	As of where I am right now I need to finish up writing the front end and adding the last few endpoints to the api. Once I'm done with that I’d like to show it to some higher ups for their opinion on the product so far and get some feedback of what needs improvement. <br><br>
	</div>
	<div style="text-indent: 50px;">
	The products state right now is around 50% complete and runs completely from a local hosts for now. <br><br>

      I've finally finished writing all the API end points as well as fixing up the database structure since the old moddel i had was pretty scuffed. now that thats done i can focus on getting feed back and expanding the front end to the teachers liking. And now that a prototype is working i can send it to people and they can tell me what they think :)<br><br>

      <div style="text-indent: 50px;"> 
	For this week I don't really have much to do since Nicole didn’t respond to my email. I guess for now I’ll just fix up the functionality of the project and add a schedule maker that takes in teacher off periods and duty preference periods and outputs a few possible rotation plans.
      </div>
      
      <div style="text-indent: 50px;">
	Also, as for git issues, everything is done and working as intended so I’ll make some issues regarding the problem above.
